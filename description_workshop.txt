This list contains all of the permanent unlock consumable items in the game.

[b]The default keybind is K, this can be changed in the controls menu[/b]

The white text items are those that affect each player individually. These are available in all worlds.

The orange text items are also player-dependent; however, they are only available on expert or master mode worlds.
In regular worlds, these items are greyed out instead.

The pink items are only able to be consumed once per world, regardless of which character used them.
